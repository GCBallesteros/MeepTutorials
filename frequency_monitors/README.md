The code here demonstrates how one can create a monitor that will show the fields at all frequencies running a single simulation.

To use the code below you will have to:
1. Run run_simulation.sh
2. Call ./show_freq_monitor --fname ring_resonator-freq-monitor.h5 --npoints 200

You can all also call ./show_freq_monitor.py --help to all the options available.

Remember to make show_freq_monitor and add_attr.py executable!

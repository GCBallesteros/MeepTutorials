# Distributed Bragg Reflectors

> This blog post is still under preparation. It may or may not work :)

Design and simulatre your own DBRs!

## Running
1. Run the simulation with and without structure. With the two results from the two simulations we can compute the scattering from the structure which we'll use to look at its reflection response.
  ```
  ./run_scattering.sh
  ```


## Extra Content

Besides the usual notebook to look at the results you'll also get for free code to simulate multilayer structures using the transfer matrix formalism. Enjoy!
